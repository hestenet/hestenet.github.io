The phantoms the fog creates are deadly to adults, so children must guard the walls now, and care for each other.<\/p><p>Ogma watches the fog from the walls of her windmill town. What felt like a game as a child becomes more of a creeping dread with each season she gets older.<\/p><blockquote><p>Because we know better.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Ogma's town is attacked\u2014alien caravanners who roam the fog in inhuman forms have come to kidnap the children, and Ogma is lost in the fog. She must find hope, find courage in herself, and find her friends.<\/p><p><em>A novel for readers who enjoy rich worldbuilding in the style of Hayao Miyazaki, a unique cast of creatures and characters that harkens back to L.
